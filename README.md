##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**  | Containers managed using Docker Compose with services for MariaDB, WordPress, and Nginx. Dockerfiles and configuration files provided for each service. Project structured around a Dockerized development environment. |
| üî© | **Code Quality**  | Makefile for managing project tasks and dependencies. Structured source code with clear separation of concerns between services such as Nginx, MariaDB, and WordPress. Consistent use of shell scripts for automation. |
| üìÑ | **Documentation** | Detailed documentation provided in the repository, including explanations of Dockerfiles, configuration files, and setup instructions for services. Readme and comments within source files enhance understanding and ease of use. |
| üîå | **Integrations**  | Dependencies on MariaDB, WordPress, Nginx. Utilizes Docker for containerization and orchestration. Nginx handles HTTPS requests for nmilan.42.fr domain. Integration with database, web server, and PHP application. |
| üß© | **Modularity**    | Services encapsulated in separate containers, promoting modularity. Configuration files for Nginx, MariaDB, WordPress kept distinct. Facilitates easy maintenance and scalability. Codebase organized into logical components. |
| üß™ | **Testing**       | Testing framework specifics not mentioned. Consider adding unit and integration tests to ensure reliability across services. Incorporate testing tools like PHPUnit, WP-CLI, and Nginx testing utilities. |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è  | **Performance**   | Efficiency dependent on Docker container performance and resource allocation. Optimizing Docker configurations and service settings can enhance speed. Monitor resource usage to ensure efficient container operation. |
| üõ°Ô∏è | **Security**      | SSL configurations for Nginx enhancing data protection. Secure database initialization in MariaDB setup. Authentication and access controls managed within containers. Continuous monitoring and updates crucial for security maintenance. |
| üì¶ | **Dependencies**  | Key dependencies include MariaDB, WordPress, Nginx, Docker, and associated libraries. Utilizes Debian Bullseye as the base image for containers. Shell scripts for automation. |
| üöÄ | **Scalability**   | Scalability supported by containerized environment. Ability to scale services horizontally by adjusting replica counts in Docker Compose. Load balancing and scaling strategies should be considered for increased traffic handling. |
