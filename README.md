##  Overview

Ft_inception orchestrates a Dockerized development environment with MariaDB, WordPress, and NGINX for seamless project setup. It handles SSL configuration, database initialization, WordPress setup, and NGINX routing, enhancing the workflow within the repository architecture. By automating service deployment and configuration, ft_inception streamlines web development setups and ensures efficient collaboration on the nmilan.42.fr project domain.

##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**  | Containers managed using Docker Compose with services for MariaDB, WordPress, and Nginx. Dockerfiles and configuration files provided for each service. Project structured around a Dockerized development environment. |
| üî© | **Code Quality**  | Makefile for managing project tasks and dependencies. Structured source code with clear separation of concerns between services such as Nginx, MariaDB, and WordPress. Consistent use of shell scripts for automation. |
| üìÑ | **Documentation** | Detailed documentation provided in the repository, including explanations of Dockerfiles, configuration files, and setup instructions for services. Readme and comments within source files enhance understanding and ease of use. |
| üîå | **Integrations**  | Dependencies on MariaDB, WordPress, Nginx. Utilizes Docker for containerization and orchestration. Nginx handles HTTPS requests for nmilan.42.fr domain. Integration with database, web server, and PHP application. |
| üß© | **Modularity**    | Services encapsulated in separate containers, promoting modularity. Configuration files for Nginx, MariaDB, WordPress kept distinct. Facilitates easy maintenance and scalability. Codebase organized into logical components. |
| üß™ | **Testing**       | Testing framework specifics not mentioned. Consider adding unit and integration tests to ensure reliability across services. Incorporate testing tools like PHPUnit, WP-CLI, and Nginx testing utilities. |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è  | **Performance**   | Efficiency dependent on Docker container performance and resource allocation. Optimizing Docker configurations and service settings can enhance speed. Monitor resource usage to ensure efficient container operation. |
| üõ°Ô∏è | **Security**      | SSL configurations for Nginx enhancing data protection. Secure database initialization in MariaDB setup. Authentication and access controls managed within containers. Continuous monitoring and updates crucial for security maintenance. |
| üì¶ | **Dependencies**  | Key dependencies include MariaDB, WordPress, Nginx, Docker, and associated libraries. Utilizes Debian Bullseye as the base image for containers. Shell scripts for automation. |
| üöÄ | **Scalability**   | Scalability supported by containerized environment. Ability to scale services horizontally by adjusting replica counts in Docker Compose. Load balancing and scaling strategies should be considered for increased traffic handling. |
